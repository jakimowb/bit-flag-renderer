The Bit Flag Render plugin allows to visualize the state of single bits in raster bands of 
with data type byte or integer.

# Features

* visualizes bit flags consisting of 1 to 3 bits (from 2 (on/off) to 8 different states)
* layer legend shows flag state colors
* predefined flag schemes, e.g. for [Landsat Quality Assessment (QA) bands](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-surface-reflectance-quality-assessment)
* allows to specify, save and reload flag schemes
* Documentation [https://bit-flag-renderer.readthedocs.io/en/latest](https://bit-flag-renderer.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
* Repository [https://github.com/jakimowb/bit-flag-renderer](https://github.com/jakimowb/bit-flag-renderer)


The Bit Flag Renderer is developed at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, [Earth Observation Lab](https://hu-berlin.de/eo-lab) 
as part of the [Land Use Monitoring System (LUMOS)](https://eo.belspo.be/en/stereo-in-action/projects/remote-sensing-image-processing-algorithms-land-use-and-land-cover) 
project. LUMOS was funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office as part of the Stereo-III research program (grant no. SR/01/349).
